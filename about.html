                <h3> <b>Who We Are. </b> </h3>
                The King's College Programming Club exists to provide students with a community which makes the learning and practice of programming more accessible for students. Similar to mathematics, learning how to code is best done through practice and tests. The club is made up of members who are interested and devoted to learning how to code and program, and apply those skills to applicative use such as web design.
                <br /> <br />
                <h3> <b> What We Do. </b> </h3>
                To help facilitate learning code, we regularly meet to practice reading and writing code without a reference sheet. Relying on a reference sheet will hinder, if not halt, true learning of how to write code. As new members join our club, we encourage them to use resources such as Code Academy to learn the basics, then practice applying the knowledge through user-designed goals and challenges.
                <br /> <br />
                <h3> <b> Why Learn Code? </b> </h3>
                Learning how to code is very beneficial for anyone's career, business, and personal satisfaction. Building your own website or blog is as satisfying as building as cooking an exquisite meal or a painting that reflects who you are and how you think. Coding unleashes the creative and productive traits inherent in everyone. It is like building a structure out of Legos, but never running out of blocks or being restricted by the size or shape of the block. Coding is limitless in what you can create or design.
                    <br />
                Professionally, coding adds to your personal utility and is noticed by most businesses as a skill that pushes someone over the edge in their application. Having the ability to code shows dedication, intuition and creativity â€“ character traits that most every professional business desires in their employees.
                <br /> <br />
                <h3> <b> How to Join. </b> </h3>
                If you are interested in bettering your thinking processes, unleashing your creativity in ways you never thought possible, or building something that helps enrich the lives of others, then we encourage you to join our club. Visit the contact page to find us on Facebook or send Kody or Jordan an email to set up a meeting.
